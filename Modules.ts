//TS are modular in nature .WE can divide our code several flies
// In Angular8 we then use "import{} from '"" to access all the code in those files(formsModule)

//We export a class, interface, variable...by addding 'export' keyword in front of it

export class ExportedCalls {
    //This is exported
}
